#### **Goals for this project**

Interactive visualization is becoming a more prominent feature of reporting. Business analytics packages tend to stress the ease with which data can be played with by non-experts. Allowing students to explore aspects of complex data rather than simply telling them what you see can be a powerful tool for learning. Within the RStudio universe this functionality is accomplished through the Shiny ecosystem. A web-app designing interface that allows web-apps to be built from within R.

In this project I will build an interactive visualization using the quiz-categories.csv and midterm-results.csv datasets. These data represent midterm results from an open book test, and lists the skills required to answer each question.
